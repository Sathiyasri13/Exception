# Exception
# 1. Even Number Checker(ExceptionEven) 
# Overview
  This C# console application prompts the user to enter a number and checks whether it is even or not. If the user enters an odd number, the program throws an exception and handles it gracefully by displaying an appropriate error message. The program demonstrates exception handling and basic input validation.

# 2. Age Validation Program(ExceptionAge)
# Overview
  This C# console application prompts the user to enter their age and validates if the entered age is within a reasonable range (between 0 and 120). The program demonstrates exception handling by throwing an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if the age is not within the valid range. It also ensures proper input validation and error handling.
